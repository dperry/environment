# Environment Setup

This repo contains my personal environment configuration of my Mac & Linux environments. The original settings came from a fellow developer Fred Taylor-Young, whom also collated them from various people, places and experience.

The GIT and VIM configuration files are not included, so once you have cloned this repo, you should grab copies by using the following instructions:

1. Git completion

 1. wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh -O .git-prompt.sh

 2. wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -O .git-completion.bash

2. Vim configuation

 1. wget http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.txt -O .vimrc
