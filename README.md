# Environment Setup

This repo contains my personal configuration of my various setups for Mac / Linux environments. The skeleton settings came from a fellow developer Fred Taylor-Young, whom also collated them from various places and experience.

Some configuration files are not included, so for optimum value once you have cloned this repo, you should pull in some extra stuff by grabbing copies of the following:

1. Git completion  

.. wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

.. mv git-prompt.sh .git-prompt.sh

.. wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

.. mv git-completion.bash .git-completion.bash

3. Vim configuation

.. wget http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.txt mv vimrc.txt .vimrc
